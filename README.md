# Team A Handbook

## Intro

## Contributing

We suppose that everybody in our new team used to work with PRs, so we're voting for PRs contributing.
We think, that PR's reviewers selection should depend on type of task. In case when changes affect all sides (backend and frontend), PR should be approved by both Frontend and Fullstack devs. In our oppinion, it would be difficult to deliver tickets and take a lot of time when we need approves from all team members every time.

## Hours

### Normal Working Hours

We have a floating schedule for the working day from 8:00am to 6:00pm(Kyiv time) (1:00am - 11:00am NY time). Most of us prefer to work 8.00am - 5.00pm.  
 
### Overlap Hours

We can shift our working hours for stand-ups, clarifications, meetings to make it comformable for all members. Also we can check-out SLACK in the evening (after usual working hours) to ask questions if something is blocking our work or if NY team is needed our participation. We hope, that we will set up our work process in the way to minimize communication at inconvenient time for both sides.

## Team Slack Etiquette

### SLACK

What are reasonable response times throughout the day? Does your team want to set a ‘quiet time’ policy? Or if individual members have specific preferences around slack.

Most of us don't open Slack after working day, but Kate, for example, monitors Slack even in the evening and tries to answer questions up to 11pm (Kyiv time).

### Channels

We think that we have enough channels by now:
the_a_team - for the organisation purposes and tech discussions,
the_a_team_random - for non-formal discussions 

## Operations

### Project Management Style

Ex-Consumer team has already worked in Agile Method. We can use any convenient tool which one you choose. Here we have the description of principles that we used before https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nVrE-vSwAuMtNyk8b-EUvQdM2IOsZYE8j-7JOrG0azA)

### Jira Process

(Our wishes for the columns structure: http://joxi.ru/12MvNlQcMvO1dA)
According to Brian's question:
`What column should a ticket be in if work has been done on it but the developer has had to move on to working on something else?`
- We propose to replace to Not Started column. Also don’t remove your assign from ticket.


### Pairing

Working in pairs depends on tasks type that we will work on.
Usually pairing for us is the communication of Frontend + Fullstack.

### 20% Time

## Team Meetings

### General & Setup

It would be very conveniently to use Slack chat for the all communication.
It simplifies everything and all info will be in one place. Also  it would be helpfull to use Status Hero to have ability to monitor the whole project's processes status. 

### Standup

It would be enough to use Status Hero for the start our team working.
I also think that JIRA should always reflect the current status of every ticket.

### Planning

Completely agreed with Brian:
Tickets should be broken down into as small of pieces as possible, though I'm not sure if that happens in grooming, planning, or both. I think doing this mostly in grooming would make planning a lot quicker.

We could vote on story points in the planning using an online app such as https://www.planitpoker.com.

### Grooming

### Retro

### Other

Define any other meetings that your team has on a regular basis.

## Team Culture

### Feedback

### Getting To Know Each Other

### Celebrating
